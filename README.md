infCore is a high-performance C# framework designed as an alternative to traditional roleplay systems. It emphasizes speed, reliability, and scalability by:

* âš¡ In-memory caching for online users, enabling rapid data access and real-time responsiveness.
* ðŸ§  Minimizing database latency by handling most operations in memory, reducing overhead and improving performance.
* ðŸ’¾ Ensuring data persistence by syncing all in-memory changes to the database, safeguarding against data loss.
* ðŸ”„ Providing a modular and extensible architecture, making it easy to integrate with existing systems or customize for specific roleplay scenarios.
